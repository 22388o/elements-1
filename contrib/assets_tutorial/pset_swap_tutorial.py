## PSET Swap Tutorial
#
# This script demonstrates how to implement an atomic swap, using a single
# Elements transaction, between two parties, Alice and Carol. Alice has
# ten thousand BTC and Carol has 1000 of a new asset. After the swap, Alice
# will have the new asset and Carol will have the BTC.
#
# This script can be executed in a Python intepreter. The user is encouraged
# to add tracing or debugging code throughout to better understand what is
# going on.
#

# the new asset.

# currently does not support iteratively creating a transaction. So we must
# create the coinjoin transaction using the raw transaction API.
#
# Our strategy will be for both parties to create single transactions, then
# we will manually combine them.
#
# This step is fairly complicated and will be significantly simplified by
# future RPC improvements.

# neither party changed the transaction out from under the other.

#
# Both parties now blind the PSET. Importantly, the final person to blind must
# have a combined PSET that has everyone else's blinding data included, so that
# they can make the blinding factors add up.
#
# The most straightforward way to implement this is to have each party blind
# the PSET, then pass to the next party, who blinds in-turn. If there are more
# than 2 parties, then you can have all parties but one blind independently,
# `combinepsbt` the results, and give this to the final party to blind.
#
# In the two-party case these are equivalent.
#

# Just for fun, try to have both parties blind independently and combine. This
# will fail because `combinepsbt` needs there to be at least one remaining
# unblinded output.
